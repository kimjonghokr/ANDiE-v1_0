ANDiE the Autonmous Neutron Diffraction Explorer

The Jupyter notebooks containted herein are of ANDiE as implemented at the WAND2 instrument at the HB-2C beamline 
at the High-Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
The outputs of the cells are consistant with the autonomous experiment run as performed on 7/24/2021 and subsequent post-processing analysis for a powder sample Fe1.09Te on WAND2.
